👋 Hello World!!! 

I’m biological human being!?!?!?! (why I felt the need for this clarification???? Bots and AI)

# Introduction

I'm driven to understand how things work. That leads me to an extremely wide range of interests.
  - Areas of interest
    - Robotics
    - Economics
    - Data Science
    - Philosophy
    - Abstract Algebra
    - Physics
    - Psychology
    - Computer Science
    - History
    - Neurology

and the list can go on and on...

# Life Strategy

- I acknowledge my programming skills limitations and so I opt by the approach of REVERSE ENGINEERING others code.

- Do not forget the below quotation by one of the greatest genius of all times:
> "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants"
>
> \-  Sir Isaac Newton 

- I have no problem in recognize that my starting point for a project is reading and understand each and every line of of a code that was already written by someone I like the style and algorithm, that is freely available, is efficient and it works (and sometimes what I consider a **beautiful code**). 

- From there I make incremental improvements (that sometimes alter completely the initial algorithm) to have code that I can relate to and make some optimizations when necessary and when it feels right. 

- With this approach I gain a more taillored and compact code that I can explain the logic and I explain why I choose the variables and functions used.

- Don't be fooled and think this is just copying.

- Even before I touch the keybord to code, I spend many hours of flow charts, pseudocode, looking to the code and try to think different alternatives to get the same result.
this method also envolves many tries and errors, debugging time included.

- My style is almost a pedrestrian and naive code. (variable and function names are self-explanatory and I try to use simple logic)

- Because of this, I will try to give the credits to the people I based my code on.


# Objectives in Life

- Be happy and make the people around me also happy
- Give back to the world some of the goodness that I'm given.

I would like to make more accessible to non-experts the lines of code and algorithms used. That's why I choose the pedestrian style of code. Make code as simple as possible  (a for Dummies approach).

# Challenges

As an inquisitive child that recursively asks "Why...? But why...? And why...?"

Knowing at which level of detail to stop asking questions, is always a challenge for me.
  - until the point of not annoying people, is the limit...
  - the time invested doesn't have return, cost-benefit analysis
  - my head hurts...

# Invitation
